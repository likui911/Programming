/*
Design and implement a Money class for calculations involving dollars and cents where arithmetic 
has to be accurate to the last cent using the 4/5 rounding rule (.5 of a cent rounds up; anything 
less than .5 rounds down). Represent a monetary amount as a number of cents in a long int, but input 
and output as dollars and cents, e.g., $123.45. Do not worry about amounts that donâ€™t fit into a long int
