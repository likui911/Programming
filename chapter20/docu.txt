"Write programs that do one thing
and do it well. Write programs
to work together."

This chapter and the next present the STL, the containers and algorithms part 
of the C++ standard library. The STL is an extensible framework for dealing with
data in a C++ program. After a first simple example, we present the general 
ideals and the fundamental concepts. We discuss iteration, linked-list manipulation, 
and STL containers. The key notions of sequence and iterator are used to tie containers 
(data) together with algorithms (processing). This chapter lays the groundwork for 
the general, efficient, and useful algorithms presented in the next chapter. As an 
example, it also presents a framework for text editing as a sample application.
