 Define a program that counts the number of words in a Document. Provide two versions: one that defines word as "a
whitespace-separated sequence of characters" and one that defines word as "a sequence of consecutive alphabetic
characters." For example, with the former definition, alpha.numeric and as12b are both single words, whereas with the
second definition they are both two words.
