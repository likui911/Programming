/*
This chapter does not say what happens when you run out of memory using new. Thatâ€™s called memory exhaustion. Find
out what happens. You have two obvious alternatives: look for documentation, or write a program with an infinite loop that
allocates but never deallocates. Try both. Approximately how much memory did you manage to allocate before failing?
